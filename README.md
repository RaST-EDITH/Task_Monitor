#  Task Monitoring ðŸ“ˆ

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Task Monitoring project is a Python-based application featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to assist users in organizing and monitoring their daily tasks. This project allows users to create a priority-based task list, add or remove tasks dynamically, and mark tasks as completed. It also provides a progress graph, offering insights into the number of tasks assigned, completed, and any tasks carried over to the next day.


## âš™ Features

- **Task List Management**: Users can create, modify, and remove tasks easily through an intuitive graphical interface. Tasks can be assigned priorities for effective time management.

- **Task Completion Tracking**: The project enables users to mark tasks as completed, providing a quick and visual overview of accomplished tasks.

- **Progress Graph Generation**: A progress graph is generated to visually represent the number of tasks assigned, completed, and any tasks carried over to the next day. This feature aids users in monitoring their daily productivity.

- **Dynamic Task Rescheduling**:  In case a task is not completed on the assigned day, the system automatically shifts the task to the next day, ensuring that nothing is overlooked.


## ðŸ’» Installation

1) **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2) **Required Libraries** : This project uses several Python libraries for data analysis and GUI development. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
## ðŸ•¹ Run Locally

1) Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RaST-EDITH/Expense-Analysis.git
```

2) Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Task_Monitor
```

3) Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
  python -m venv venv
```

4) Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:

```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
```

5) Install the project dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6) Now, you have all the necessary packages installed in your virtual environment. You can start using the project. 
To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done, simply run:

```bash
  deactivate
```
## ðŸ“Š Usage

- **Task Management**: Use the GUI interface to add, remove, or modify tasks. Assign priorities to tasks for effective time management.

- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed when finished to track your daily achievements.

- **Progress Graph**: View the progress graph to gain insights into the number of tasks assigned, completed, and any tasks carried over to the next day.

- **Dynamic Task Rescheduling**: If a task is not completed on the assigned day, the system will automatically shift it to the next day.

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Utilize the Task Monitoring project regularly to monitor your task completion progress and maintain an organized approach to your daily work.
